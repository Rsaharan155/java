        System.out.println("In Java one can write program on any OS, name it with extenstion '.java', now complie it we get a file with same name but with extenstion '.class'. Now a Interpreter is required to run the '.class' file");
        System.out.println("JVM is the interpreter- After compile we get a .class file and this file can be run on any OS.(Note: Each OS should have its JVM installed in the system to run this .class file)");
        System.out.println("2. Java have Multithreading concept- Multithreading concept first introduced by java only");
        System.out.println("Multithreading is when within an application multiple programs are running- In actual its like we have 2 programs that are seems to run simultaneously on screen but in actual OS run one line of program1 then it run one line of program2 then get back to program1.");
        System.out.println("Multithreading and Multitasking are different- As Multithreading is within an Application while Multitasking is many applications are running simultaneously");
        System.out.println("3. Memory management is very good in java- Concept of Garbage collector");
        System.out.println("4. It is very Secure");
        System.out.println("5. It is very Robust");
